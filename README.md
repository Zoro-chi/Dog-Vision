## Overview üåü
The **Dog Vision** project aims to classify dog breeds from images by applying **deep learning**. It was inspired by the growing applications of **AI/ML** in solving real-world problems, and specifically how computer vision can be used for image classification tasks.

This project utilizes a **pre-trained deep learning model** and fine-tunes it on a dog breed dataset to create a model capable of accurately identifying different dog breeds.

Key features:
- Uses a **pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for feature extraction and classification.
- Trains on a dog breed dataset and evaluates model performance.
- Can be easily extended to add more breeds or integrate into web or mobile applications.

### Try It in Google Colab üöÄ
You can explore the project and test the model directly in Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mUlKP1rcdfFHV3xq5cAYygh5bV5xWh_S?usp=sharing). 

## Model üß†
The model is based on a **pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN)**. The model was fine-tuned on a dog breed dataset using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. For this project, the **VGG16** architecture was chosen due to its efficiency in image classification tasks.

### Training:
- **Dataset**: A large dataset of images of various dog breeds.
- **Model Architecture**: VGG16 with fine-tuning.
- **Optimizer**: Adam Optimizer.
- **Loss Function**: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy.

### Accuracy:
- The model achieved an accuracy of **95%** on the test set.
